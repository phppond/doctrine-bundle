# doctrine-bundle
======================

1) Installing
------------------------

### Using Composer

As Symfony uses [Composer][1] to manage its dependencies, the recommended way to install this bundle is to use it.

If you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on
[http://getcomposer.org/][1] or just run the following command:

    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Then, use the `require` command to download this bundle:

    php composer.phar require phppond/doctrine-bundle:@stable


2) Usage

```php
